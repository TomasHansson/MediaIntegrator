# MediaIntegrator
A small project done during a C#/.NET course at Karlstads university.

A simple program ment to emulate a piece of software used as an integration tool between two 
different mediashops that uses different types of files to store their products.

What I Learned:
- Using FileSystemWatcher to call functions when files are created or updated.
- Using XmlWriter to write XML-files.
- Using XDocument and XElement to read XML-files.
